The memory of a cmputer can be considered an array of bytes. Each
byte of me=mory has an address. The first byte is at adedress 0, the second
byte at address 1 , and so on until the last byte of the computer's memory.
In modern CPUs there are hardware mapping registers which are used
to give each process a protected address space. This means that multiple
people can each run a program which starts at address Ox4004c8 at the
same time. These processes perceive the same "logical" addresses, while
they are using memory at different "physical" addresses.
